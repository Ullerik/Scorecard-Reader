# Scorecard-Reader

Here you can find code for reading scorecards for Speedcubing Competitions.
If you have a way to scan your scorecards, you can put them in a folder, change some path names in the notebook file, and run it.
It will automatically do an inital sorting of the scorecards, which also creates json files with all the relevant information on the scorecard.
The images and belonging json files can be opened with a double checking program to view the results of the program side by side with the image.
After checking and fixing any potential mistakes, you can send the time to WCA live.

The idea is to make scoretaking less stressful. Per now, the program takes a little while to run (<1 minute for 100 scorecards), after which a double checking program takes over.
If you have an efficient way of scanning the scorecards, we think this can make the scoretaking process a much faster, at least if you have a lot of scorecards.
For now the program is not very user friendly, but I plan on making it better in the future.
